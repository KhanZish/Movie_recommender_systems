I built a movie recommender system using data science techniques. It basically suggests movies based on what a user has watched or rated before. I used collaborative filtering and content-based filtering to make personalized recommendations. It analyzes things like genres, actors, and user preferences to predict what someone might like next. The system also improves over time as it gets more data. I worked with machine learning models like KNN and SVD to make the recommendations more accurate. It was a fun project, and it really shows how data can enhance user experience
